# NeoCron

## Introduction

NeoCron is a modern, lightweight cron scheduling react component that is styled using tailwind. It is influenced and built upon [cron-converter](https://github.com/roccivic/cron-converter) project.

## Getting started

1. Clone down the repo
2. install all dependencies using NPM
3. run npm run dev to run the application locally on port localhost:3000

## Styling

NeoCron is styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Radix is a component library that provides pre-built UI components such as Selects, Buttons, Alerts and many more. Shadcn styles these base Radix components and provides a plug-and-play experience for developers building front-end components.
